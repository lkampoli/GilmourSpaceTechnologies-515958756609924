\subsection{The Aachen Bomb}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The \href{https://develop.openfoam.com/Development/openfoam/-/tree/OpenFOAM-v2106/tutorials/lagrangian/sprayFoam/aachenBomb}{AachenBomb} testcase is the simulation of combustion inside a constant volume chamber that mimics the begining of power stroke in a 4 stroke engine. The experimental setup of the combustion chamber is in RWTH Aachen university, and the operating conditions are in accordance with the Engine Combustion Network\footnote{https://crf.sandia.gov/research/engine-combustion.}

As mentioned before the geometry of AachenBomb case is similar to the constant volume combustion chamber in RWTH Aachen. The geometry is a cuboid with height(+ve y-axis) 0.1 m and base 0.02x0.02 m (figure 2.1). The injector is placed 5 mm below the top of the chamber (at a height 0.995 m from the bottom plane) in order to avoid boundary effects on the injected fluid. The fluid
that is injected is n-Heptane (C7H16).

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Prepare the case directory by copying a tutorial \\ (e.g., \texttt{tutorials/combustion/reactingFoam/ras/counterFlowFlame2D}).
    \item Modify configuration files (\texttt{controlDict}, \texttt{fvSchemes}, \texttt{fvSolution}).
    \item Run the simulation:
