\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
A gas generator is a critical component in certain rocket engine designs, particularly those employing a gas-generator cycle. The gas generator is a small combustion chamber within the rocket engine that burns a portion of the propellants to produce hot, high-pressure gas. This gas is not used directly for thrust but instead powers the turbopumps that feed the main combustion chamber with propellants. The gas generator cycle is known for its simplicity and reliability, making it a popular choice for many modern rocket engines.

In particular, the system under investigation runs on non-hypergolic propellant LOX/Jet A-1 in a fuel-rich cycle.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{LOx (Liquid Oxygen):} LOx is a highly efficient oxidizer with excellent performance characteristics. It is widely available, relatively inexpensive, and can be stored at cryogenic temperatures.
    \item \textbf{Jet-A1:} Jet-A1 is a kerosene-based fuel commonly used in aviation. It has a high energy density, good thermal stability, and low toxicity compared to other rocket fuels like hydrazine. Jet-A1 is less volatile than liquid hydrogen, making it easier and safer to handle.
\end{itemize}

The combination of LOx and Jet-A1 provides a balance of performance, cost-effectiveness, and operational simplicity, making it ideal for gas-generator-cycle engines.

Among key components of the LOx/Jet-A1 gas generator we find:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Propellant Injection System:} A small fraction of LOx and Jet-A1 is diverted from the main propellant flow and injected into the gas generator. The injector ensures proper mixing of the oxidizer (LOx) and fuel (Jet-A1) for efficient combustion.
    \item \textbf{Combustion Chamber:} The gas generator has a dedicated combustion chamber where LOx and Jet-A1 are burned. Unlike the main combustion chamber, the gas generator operates at lower pressures and temperatures to avoid damaging downstream components like the turbine.
    \item \textbf{Turbine Drive Gas:} The combustion products from the gas generator are hot gases (primarily $\text{CO}_2$, $\text{H}_2\text{O}$, and some unburned hydrocarbons) that drive the turbine. These gases are typically cooler than those in the main combustion chamber to prevent overheating the turbine blades.
    \item \textbf{Turbopump Assembly:} The turbine converts the thermal energy of the gas into mechanical energy, which drives the fuel and oxidizer pumps. The pumps pressurize the LOx and Jet-A1 before they are fed into the main combustion chamber.
    \item \textbf{Exhaust System:} After driving the turbine, the exhaust gases from the gas generator are either vented overboard or directed into the main nozzle to contribute a small amount of additional thrust.
\end{itemize}

Advantages of the gas generator cycle may include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Simplicity:} The gas generator cycle is mechanically simpler than staged combustion or expander cycles, reducing development time and cost.
    \item \textbf{Reliability:} The lower operating pressures and temperatures in the gas generator reduce thermal and mechanical stresses on components.
    \item \textbf{Reusability:} Engines using the gas generator cycle, such as SpaceX's Merlin engine, have demonstrated reusability, lowering the cost of space launches.
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} The design can be scaled up or down depending on mission requirements.
\end{itemize}

\section{Physical models}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The combustion of kerosene can be approximated by the following global reaction:
%
\begin{equation}
    \text{C}_{12}\text{H}_{26} + 18.5\text{O}_2 \rightarrow 12\text{CO}_2 + 13\text{H}_2\text{O}
\end{equation}
%
This reaction represents the complete combustion of dodecane ($\text{C}_{12}\text{H}_{26}$), a common surrogate for kerosene. {Kerosene combustion} involves complex chemical reactions, heat release, and interactions between turbulence and chemistry which demands for appropriate modelling. Options available in OpenFOAM are listed below.

%\begin{itemize} % Customize bullet points
%    \item \textbf{Thermophysical Properties}: Density, viscosity, specific heat, thermal conductivity, and latent heat of vaporization.
%    
%    \item \textbf{Chemical Kinetics}: Reaction mechanisms for kerosene combustion (e.g., simplified mechanisms like single-step global reactions or detailed mechanisms).
%    
%    \item \textbf{Combustion Regimes}: Premixed, non-premixed (diffusion), or partially premixed combustion.

        \item Taylor Analogy Breakup (\textbf{TAB})~\cite{o1987tab}.
        \item Enhanced Taylor Analogy Breakup (\textbf{ETAB})~\cite{tanner1997liquid,tanner1998simulation}.
        \item Secondary Breakup Model (\textbf{SHF})~\cite{schmehl2000cfd} to account for the different breakup regimes, such as bag, multimode, shear.
        \item \textbf{PilchErdman}~\cite{pilch1987use}. Particle secondary breakup model based on the Pilch-Erdman total droplet breakup model.\\
        The droplet fragment velocity is described by the equation:
        \[
            V_d = V \sqrt{\epsilon}(B_1 T + B_2 T^2)
        \]
        where:\\
        
        \begin{tabular}{lp{8cm}}
            $V_d$      & Fragment velocity \\
            $V$        & Magnitude of the relative velocity \\
            $\epsilon$ & Density ratio ($\rho_{\text{carrier}} / \rho_{\text{droplet}}$) \\
            $T$        & Characteristic break-up time \\

            $B_2$      & Model coefficient \\
        \end{tabular}\\
        
        The authors suggest the following values for $B_1$ and $B_2$:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Compressible flow: $B_1 = 0.75 \times 1.0$, $B_2 = 3 \times 0.116$
            \item Incompressible flow: $B_1 = 0.75 \times 0.5$, $B_2 = 3 \times 0.0758$

        \item \textbf{LiquidEvapFuchsKnudsen}~\cite{chen2017numerical}: Liquid evaporation/condensation model for solution of liquid and solid. This model takes into account the Fuchs-Knudsen number correction, the modified Raoult's law is used to obtain the concentration of the evaporable component on the surface, and the activity coefficient is used. The correction Kelvin effect is used.
        \item \textbf{LiquidEvaporationBoil}: Liquid evaporation model using ideal gas assumption and including boiling model based on~\cite{zuo2000studies}.

%
   \item \textbf{\hl{Soot model}}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{grpRadiationSootSubModels}: Liquid evaporation model using ideal gas assumption.
         This soot model is purely a state model. The amount of soot produced is determined by a single-step chemistry as:
        \[
            \nu_f \text{Fuel} + \nu_{\text{Ox}} \text{Ox} = \nu_P P + \nu_{\text{Soot}} \text{Soot}
        \]
        $\nu_{\text{Soot}}$ is prescribed by the user. The single-step chemistry used is read from the combustion. The soot is not considered in the thermodynamics of the system and is not treated as an extra species in the solver.
        
        The spatial distribution is given by the normalization of the first product on the right-hand side (RHS) of the reaction by default, or it can be added as input.
        
        The input dictionary reads as follows in the \texttt{radiationProperties} dictionary:

            \item Parcel velocity is calculated as:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Constant velocity:
                        \begin{verbatim}
U = <specified by user>
                        \end{verbatim}

U = V_dot/(A*Cd)
                        \end{verbatim}
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{InflationInjection}. Inflation injection - creates new particles by splitting existing particles within a set of generation cells, then inflating them to a target diameter within the generation cells and an additional set of inflation cells.
        \item \textbf{InjectedParticleDistributionInjection}. Interrogates an \texttt{injectedParticleCloud} to convert the raw particle data into a set of 'binned' injectors.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Diameters are converted into \texttt{general distributions} with a user-specified bin width.
            \item Raw velocity and diameter data are resampled and stored to provide variations per injector.
        \end{itemize}
        The mass to inject can be set according to the raw input data mass total by using the \texttt{applyDistributionMassTotal} switch.
        \item \textbf{InjectedParticleInjection}. Replays a set of particle data using the assumption of one particle per parcel based on an \texttt{injectedParticleCloud}.\\
        Example usage in the configuration file:
        \begin{verbatim}
model1
{
    type            injectedParticleInjection;
    SOI             0;
    massTotal       0; // Place holder only
    parcelBasisType fixed;
    nParticle       1; // 1 particle per parcel
    cloud           eulerianParticleCloud;
    positionOffset  (-0.025 2 -0.025);
}
        \end{verbatim}
        \item \textbf{InjectionModel}.
        Templated injection model class.
        The injection model nominally describes the parcel:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Position
            \item Diameter
            \item Velocity
        \end{itemize}
        In this case, the \texttt{fullyDescribed()} flag should be set to 0 (\texttt{false}). When the parcel is then added to the cloud, the remaining properties are populated using values supplied in the constant properties.
        
        If, however, all of a parcel's properties are described in the model, the \texttt{fullDescribed()} flag should be set to 1 (\texttt{true}).
        \item \textbf{grpLagrangianIntermediateInjectionSubModels}
        Particle injection sources read from a look-up table. Each row corresponds to an injection site.
        \begin{verbatim}

    \item{\hl{\textbf{Combustion model}}}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    
    OpenFOAM supports several combustion models depending on the combustion regime, as reported in Table~\ref{tab:combustion-solvers}:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Premixed combustion}: Use the \texttt{XiFoam} solver with flame-wrinkling models.
    \item \textbf{Non-premixed combustion}: Use the \texttt{reactingFoam} solver with PDF-based approaches.
    \item \textbf{Partially premixed combustion}: Use the \texttt{fireFoam} solver for LES simulations.
    \item  \textbf{Partially stirred reactor turbulent combustion model.}  This model calculates a finite rate, based on both turbulence and chemistry time scales. Depending on mesh resolution, the Cmix parameter can be used
    to scale the turbulence mixing time scale.
    \item \textbf{Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC) turbulent combustion model.}
    This model considers that the reaction occurs in the regions of the flow
    where the dissipation of turbulence kinetic energy takes place (fine
    structures). The mass fraction of the fine structures and the mean residence
    time are provided by an energy cascade model.
%
    There are many versions and developments of the EDC model, 4 of which are
    currently supported in this implementation: v1981, v1996, v2005 and
    v2016.  The model variant is selected using the optional version entry in
    the EDCCoeffs dictionary.

In~\cite{wang2018physics,xu2018physics}, the \href{https://web.stanford.edu/group/haiwanglab/HyChem}{HyChem} (Hybrid Chemistry) approach to modeling the combustion chemistry of real liquid fuels was developed. The approach takes advantage of the key physics underlying the high-temperature combustion of large hydrocarbon fuels.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pyrolysis/oxidative pyrolysis of the fuel occurs first, followed by oxidation of the pyrolysis products.
    \item The oxidation of the pyrolysis products is rate-limiting in the overall fuel oxidation process.
    \item The combustion of the multicomponent fuel follows the principle of large fuel components \cite{xu2019principle}.
\end{enumerate}

The approach combines experimentally constrained, lumped reaction steps for fuel pyrolysis and oxidative pyrolysis with detailed reaction models for the pyrolysis and oxidation of the fuel pyrolysis products. 

For conventional petroleum-derived fuels, the pyrolysis products considered are usually:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ethylene ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_4$),
    \item Hydrogen ($\text{H}_2$),
    \item Methane ($\text{CH}_4$),
    \item Propene ($\text{C}_3\text{H}_6$),
    \item Iso-butene ($\text{i-C}_4\text{H}_8$),
    \item 1-Butene ($\text{1-C}_4\text{H}_8$),
    \item Benzene ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_6$),
    \item Toluene ($\text{C}_7\text{H}_8$),
    \item Two radical species ($\text{CH}_3$ and $\text{H}$).
\end{itemize}

Other species can be added as needed, depending on the fuel composition. For example, the pyrolysis products of some synthetic fuels can vary with respect to the composition and molecular structure of the parent fuel.

High-speed flow simulations encounter many challenges, such as modeling the high-speed flow-turbulence-chemistry interaction. To simulate these effects accurately, highly refined mesh size as well as \textbf{finite rate chemistry (FRC)} are typically needed, which could easily cause prohibitive computation cost. Even though the low-manifold models such as \textbf{flamelet/progress-variable (FPV)} model is used in some supersonic combustion~\cite{cymbalist2016application}, it is pointed out in~\cite{mrema2019large} that most of these low-manifold models need complicated corrections when applied to fully compressible flows and often mispredict key physical quantities. As a result, \textbf{mechanism reduction} has to be employed for FRC simplifications.

The most commonly seen simplification methodology in combustion simulations is a priori chemical mechanism reduction, such as the methods of \textbf{Direct Relation Graph (DRG)}~\cite{lu2005directed}, \textbf{DRG with Error Propagation (DRGEP)}~\cite{pepiot2008efficient}, \textbf{Path Flux Analysis}~\cite{sun2010path}, and \textbf{Global Pathway Selection (GPS)}~\cite{gao2016global}. The conventional way for mechanism reduction is to
generate the mechanisms under a certain range of operating conditions a priori and subsequently implement these reduced mechanisms into computational fluid dynamics (CFD) combustion simulations. In recent years, the concept of \textbf{dynamic adaptive chemistry (DAC)} scheme which reduces the mechanism on-the-fly at each time step and at each local
computational cell has been extensively studied in reactive flow simulations~\cite{cymbalist2016application,yang2017parallel}. In this way, the number of species could be reduced to smaller values than the conventional calculations, but the on-the-fly mechanism reduction process
itself could incur CPU cost. The tabulated chemistry techniques further reduce the effort of mechanism reduction process as well as the chemistry integration process. Examples of combining DAC and tabulated chemistry can be
found in~\cite{contino2011coupling,yang2017sensitivity,zhou2018computational}.

\textbf{Tabulated dynamic adaptive chemistry (TDAC)}~\cite{contino2011coupling}. is used to accelerate the finite rate chemistry
integration. TDAC is an algorithm that combines in situ adaptive tabulation (ISAT)~\cite{pope1997computationally} and dynamic adaptive chemistry (DAC)~\cite{liang2009dynamic}. In conventional DAC, the mechanism reduction process is conducted at each time step and each grid point to generate an optimal reduced mechanism considering the local and current thermodynamic conditions and species composition. However, the mechanism reduction process could incur expensive computation, especially with large amount of grid points. In TDAC, this issue is addressed by the ISAT technique, which only requires mechanism reduction when the current and local state is not within the accuracy region of the tabulated chemistry. In ISAT, this accuracy region is quantified and the tabulation is dynamically increased. Another important feature of TDAC is the reduction on species transport equations. When reduced mechanism is produced and unimportant species are eliminated, only the important species transport equations are solved, which further significantly reduce the computational cost.

    OpenFOAM requires thermophysical properties for kerosene (e.g., Jet A/A-1) to be defined in the \texttt{constant/thermophysicalProperties} file. Surrogate fuels like n-decane or n-dodecane are often used to approximate kerosene properties.

\subsubsection*{Mesh generation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The mesh generation process in OpenFOAM relies on tools like \texttt{blockMesh}, \texttt{snappyHexMesh} or  \texttt{cfMesh}.

\subsubsection*{Initial conditions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection*{Boundary conditions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The \textbf{fixedFluxPressure} is a pressure boundary condition to set the pressure gradient to the provided value such that the flux on the boundary is that specified by the velocity boundary condition. This condition ensures the correct flux at fixed-flux boundaries by compensating for the body forces (gravity in particular) with the pressure gradient.

The \textbf{waveTransmissive} is a general boundary condition that provides a wave transmissive outflow condition, based on solving DDt(W, field) = 0 at the boundary, W is the wave velocity and field is the field to which this boundary condition is applied.

The \textbf{totalPressure} is a boundary condition that sets the static pressure at the patch based on a specification of the total pressure, . The mode of operation is determined via the input entries and the dimensions of the convective flux, phi ().

Define boundary conditions in the \texttt{0/U} file:

\begin{lstlisting}[language={}, caption={Boundary Conditions in OpenFOAM}]
boundaryField
{
    inlet
    {
        type            fixedValue;
        value           uniform (10 0 0); // Velocity vector
    }
    outlet
    {
        type            zeroGradient;
    }
    walls
    {
        type            noSlip;
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection*{Post-Processing}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Use OpenFOAM utilities and ParaView for post-processing:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Visualize temperature, species concentrations, and velocity fields.
    \item Analyze flame structure, ignition delay, and pollutant formation (e.g., NOx, CO).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Stability and Convergence in Reacting Flows}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Obtaining a converged solution in a reacting flow can be difficult for a number of reasons. First, the impact of the chemical reaction on the basic flow pattern may be strong, leading to a model in which there is strong coupling between the mass/momentum balances and the species transport equations. This is especially true in combustion, where the reactions lead to a large heat release and subsequent density changes and large accelerations in the flow. All reacting systems have some degree of coupling, however, when the flow properties depend on the species concentrations. These coupling issues are best addressed by the use of a two-step solution process and by the use of under-relaxation.

A second convergence issue in reacting flows involves the magnitude of the reaction source term. When the ANSYS FLUENT model involves very rapid reaction rates (reaction time scales are much faster than convection and diffusion time scales), the solution of the species transport equations becomes numerically difficult. Such systems are termed "stiff'' systems. Stiff systems with laminar chemistry can be solved using either the pressure-based solver with the Stiff Chemistry Solver option enabled, or the density-based solver. The laminar chemistry model may also be used for turbulent flames, where turbulence-chemistry interactions are neglected. However, for such flames, the Eddy-Dissipation Concept or PDF Transport models, which account for turbulence-chemistry interactions, may be a better choice. 

\subsubsection{Ignition in Combustion Simulations}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% https://www.afs.enea.it/project/neptunius/docs/fluent/html/ug/node801.htm#sec-patch
If you introduce fuel to an oxidant, spontaneous ignition does not occur unless the temperature of the mixture exceeds the activation energy threshold required to maintain combustion. This physical issue manifests itself in an ANSYS FLUENT simulation as well. If you are using the laminar finite-rate, finite-rate/eddy-dissipation, Eddy-Dissipation Concept or PDF Transport model for turbulence-chemistry interaction, you have to supply an ignition source to initiate combustion. This ignition source may be a heated surface or inlet mass flow that heats the gas mixture above the required ignition temperature. Often, however, it is the equivalent of a spark: an initial solution state that causes combustion to proceed. You can supply this initial spark by patching a hot temperature into a region of the ANSYS FLUENT model that contains a sufficient fuel/air mixture for ignition to occur.

\section{Conclusion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A number of critical points for this numerical simulation's campaign have been highlighted, such as:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item Increase of the computational cost with detailed chemistry.
    \item Choice of the appropriate turbulence-chemistry interaction models (e.g., EDC, PDF).
    \item Validation of the results against experimental data or benchmark cases.
\end{itemize}
